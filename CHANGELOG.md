## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- DSH WebUI composer control for managing six capability families: skills, MCP servers, tools, prompt injections, approval escalation, and safety guards.
- Session-, project-, and global-level overrides with session-first precedence and an explicit unset/inherit state.
- Scoped enforcement that removes disabled tools and skills from the model-visible capability surface and rejects forced calls.
- Five opt-in safety guards: read-only mode, secret-file protection, dangerous-shell confirmation, destructive-git confirmation, and outbound-network confirmation.
- Bilingual English and Simplified Chinese interface and documentation.
- Responsive, centered capability panel with per-row resolved status, MCP member-tool expansion, and idle-only editing.
- Persistent settings with last-known inventory fallback so state remains visible across agent turn boundaries.
- Prebuilt Host and client bundles for tag-based installation without an install-time build step.
